MMU (Memory Management Unit) System - 
An external MMU system built from scratch using three different cache algorithms for the Paging System - LRU, Second Chance and Random.
For reuse purposes, all code is bundled into one JAR and by that implemented the Strategy pattern.
For easier planning and maintenance MVC was used. 
To improve performance, multi-threading programming was used. 
This also includes a client side built with Swing (Java) and usage of JSON for passing data between server/client.
